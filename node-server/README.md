## How to login/register?

You can login/register by sending a POST request to

```
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register
```
with the following data 

```
{
  "email": "alexey@email.com",
  "password":"123"
}
```

You should receive an access token with the following format 

```
{
   "access_token": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
}
```


You should send this authorization with any request to the protected endpoints

```
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```
