### Q1) Why re-write the exisiting angular app?

1. The current angular app was developed to discover the psychiatrists needs. The system could not have been pre-architected to deliver the discovered features.

2. The current angular app is in 1.x and LTS ends in July 2021. Also good libraries are not being developed on Angular 1.x

### Q2) What new features are built into the new architecture?

#### A. User experience benefits

1. When page is reloaded and there is no/slow connection to DB server the page should load from localstorage immediately.

2. When a component is already on the doctor browser and the doctor gives the commanbd "rec" then the recommendations show immediately from localcache and api is fired in the back. If the api returns new data the view is updated. (lazy-read)

3. When doctor adds a rec, the view gets updated. If server update fails then the view is reverted. (lazy-write)

4. When doctor is offline and open a patient file they see the page. #not-working

5. In each table column has priorities. So when less space is available low priority columns get hidden https://phppot.com/css/automatic-column-hiding-using-css-in-responsive-table

6. When there is space two components can come beside each other. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_two_columns_responsive

#### B. Developer benefits

1. **Temporal DB**: No need to maintain created and discontinued on related fields. Each table 8 fields are replaced with 3 fields.

2. **ORM**: On server side interaction with DB is through ORM [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). 

    1A. So standard queries are already written.

    1B. DB versioning and migrations can happen. [https://github.com/savantcare/healthbrain/blob/master/node-server/models/recommendation.model.js]

3. **elelemt.io**

4. Maintain state on the client. When recommendation card state changes the rec panel changes its view automatically.
In the current angular app the recommendation panel was listening on socket and then receiving HTML to update its view.

5. No HTML is generated on server. All view is inside the .vue component. This view works on json returned by the server api. This allows different UIs to be written.

### Q3) Why was vue chosen over angular latest version?
1. More github stars. Take this as a voting from worldwide developers.

2. Simpler to understand

3. Useful libraries
    1. vuex
    2. https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator ( https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-reusable-forms-using-vue-form-generator/ )

    4. https://github.com/shentao/vue-multiselect
    5. https://dafrok.github.io/v-hotkey/#/step/4
    6. https://github.com/ElemeFE/element
       A. Add and close tab good design: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/tabs#add-close-tab
       B. Inline form validation: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/form#validation
       C. Good looking form: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/form#basic-form
       D. History shown as timeline https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/timeline
       E. Card for right side: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/card
       F. confirming actions does not take huge mouse movement: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/popconfirm
       G. https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/popover#popover -> Mouse over help looks good.
       H. Doing multiple adds in same form: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/form#delete-or-add-form-items-dynamically
	7. Table: Responsive and Draggable.

   
### Q4) Should a table library be used or developed internally?

![card-table-features](./docs/analyzing-features-of-card-table.png)

Features needed:

1. KB to go up and down the data rows
2. Multi select using only KB or mouse.
3. Actions for each data row invoked using keyboard single key.
4. When multiple rows are selected then invoke "Multi select actions"
5. Tabbed tables -> First tab shows table 1 and 2nd tab shows table 2. Used at "Your recommendations" "Others recommendations"

For the tabs each tab can be a table component. And the tabs are displayed using Vueâ€™s <component> element with the is special attribute:
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Dynamic-Components

6. Drag to reorder rows

7. Responsive tables https://elvery.net/demo/responsive-tables/ -> less important columns are hidden and that data is sent to tooltip. For e.g. in case of recommendations -> Created at and Actions are less important columns and they are hidden when width is less. The content of created at is sent to tooltip.

#### Current choice:

Example of draggable and responsive table in VUE https://jsfiddle.net/d7jqtkon/

Libraries used:
1. https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/table-example -> This gives draggable feature
2. https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/table -> This gives responsive feature


### Q5) Why was expressJS chosen over laravel?

Laravel: Used by 660 and Stars 59K

express nodejs: used by 6.6M and Stars 49K

Sequlize nodejs: Used by 190K and Stars 22K

### Q6) Why each component should be in its own repo?

When recommendation a new version is released Sanjay wants to do git pull only for recommendation repo on the prod server.

#### Q6.1) Why not try branching concept?
Sometimes we need to invite external developers to work on a component and we do not want to give them access to the git repo containing other components

#### Q6.2) Why is each component not a seperate npm package?

The goal is for recommendation-panel and recommendation-card to have the same vuex store. So when the state changes in recommendation-panel the view of recommendation-card is automatically updated.

[The code till 4th May](https://github.com/vikaskedia/healthbrain) implemented recommendation-panel and recommendation-card as two different npm packages. Different npm packages cannot share the same vuex store.

Hence recommendation-panel and recommendation-card cannot be two seperate npm packages they have to be components of the same vue app.

### Q7) How to reduce boilerplate code?

Have three types of components? #Todo

1. UI components: Reusable across the whole app. They communicate just by using props and events, not holding any application logic.

2. Layout components: App will have only 1 of these. Like header and footer.

3. Domain components: 

Ref: https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/structuring-vue-components/


### Q8) How are the components structured?

#### Option1:

<RecommendationsCard>

<CardHeader Prop{Title=Recommendation}>
</CardHeader>

<DataTable Prop{row1:(a,b),row2:(c,d)}>
</DataTable>

</RecommendationsCard>

#### Option2:

<GenericCard Prop{Title=Recommendation, row1:(a,b),row2:(c,d)} >

</GenericCard>

Why is Option 1 better:

Theory: RecommendationsCard is using libraries and in option 2 RecommendationsCard is using a framework. Ref: https://www.programcreek.com/2011/09/what-is-the-difference-between-a-java-library-and-a-framework/

Practical:
1. Under option 1 I can decide not to use the cardHeader sub component and write my own card header in some cases like "Date of birth component"


### Q9) How to do theming for the app while each component maintains its own scoped local context style?

### Q10) How is the state of patient on a historical date generated?

#### Architecture 1

Suppose doctor wants the state of the paitent on 15th Jan 2020:

The query is:
select * from recommendationsTable where patientID=1 and createdBy < "15th Jan 2020" and ( discontinuedDate > "15th Jan 2020" or discontinuedDate == NULL)
This returns JSON A


Suppose doctor wants the state of the paitent on 10th Mar 2020:
The query is:
select * from recommendationsTable where patientID=1 and createdBy < "10th Mar 2020" and ( discontinuedDate > "10th Mar 2020" or discontinuedDate == NULL)
This returns JSON B

Suppose the doctor wants to know the state of the patient on 9th March 2020:
This requires the same API as above.

Dis-Advantages of architecture 1:
1. Too many sql queries. But the data center is big and there are read only copies of MYSQL running from RAM ready to serve these queries. It is better to offload the complexity to the hardware instead of software. Wisdom says it is better to have expensive hardware and simple software.

#### Architecture 2

The first query is:
select * from recommendationsTable where patientID=1;
This returns JSON C

Now all queries about the state of recommendation are made on the client side.

Advantages of architecture 2:
1. Less number of queries to server.

Dis-Advantages of architecture 2:
1. How to run sql query over a JSON on the browser client side. Use https://vuex-orm.org/ with https://github.com/vuex-orm/plugin-axios and https://github.com/vuex-orm/plugin-soft-delete (bring discontinued to industry standard by calling it soft delete)


### Q12) Why use an auto doc generator?

 Decided not to use storybook since want something where the code is auto parsed.

 So for vue client side code decided to use [vue-styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist)
 Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryyAiUYvfY8
